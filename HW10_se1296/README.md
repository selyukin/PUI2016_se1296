# HW 10

## These two assignments are based off the lab prepared by Dr. Kashuk on geospatial autocorrelation.

### Assignment 1 is simply a spruced up version of the lab, with the addition of explanatory captions for the plots and maps generated. The code is from the lab, the explanations are provided by me.
### Assignment 2 is a modification of Assignment 1, looking at average monthly CitiBike ridership per tract not for all months, but rather comparing average monthly ridership for summer and winter months. The code is mostly from the lab, but inludes my own for separating out months and generating side-by-side plots and maps. All explanations are my own. 

### I collaborated on this HW with Sebastian Bana, Scott Smith, Tyler Woebkenberg, and Bailey Griswold.
