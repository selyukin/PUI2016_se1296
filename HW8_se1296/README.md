# Homework 8

## Assignment 1: Finish Data Linkage Lab
   This assignment required merging together three separate datasets. Though one contained information on 311 complaints, one on population, and one on internet infrastructure, all were either at or could be aggregated to the NYC community district level. In order to merge the datasets for a deeper analysis of community districs, the representation of this attribute (i.e. the identifier or the link between the datasets) had to be manipulated to match exactly across all three.
   I collaborated on this assignment with Sebastian Bana Gutierrez, Benjamin Alpert, Scott Smith, and Jonathan Geis.
   
## Assignment 2: Review Plots
   For this assingment, I reviewed the plots created by Sebastian Bana Gutierrez (sbg389, https://github.com/sbg389/PUI2016_sbg389/tree/master/HW7_sbg389) and by Jie Zhou (jz2792, https://github.com/jzhou0131/PUI2016_jz2792/tree/master/HW7_jz2792).


### This directory also contains the notebook creating the plot for HW7. I used a dataset available on CUSP's Data Facility which contains NYC green taxi trip data for 2015. The dataset can also be found on NYC's Open Data portal at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Green-Taxi-Trip-Data/gi8d-wdg5.
