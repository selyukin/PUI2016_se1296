### Assignment 1: NYC Energy Data
I worked on this assignment with Sebastian Bana, Ben Alpert, and Scott Smith. Code is taken primarily from the building_nrg_instructions skeleton notebook and previous homework assignments. The task was to determine whether the number of units in a building is a good proxy for/predictor of its total energy consumption.

### Assignment 2: Complete Citi Bike Project
I worked together with Sebastian Bana, Ben Alpert, and Jonathan Geis to complete this assignment. Luis Fernando Melchor and Scott Smith were part of the origial group during week three when discussing null hypotheses.
